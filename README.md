# Pagination Project

This Python project focuses on implementing pagination functionalities for a database of popular baby names. The project consists of several tasks, each building on the previous one to enhance the pagination experience for large datasets.

## Tasks

1. **Simple Helper Function**: Implement a function that calculates the start and end indexes for pagination. This function aids in determining the appropriate range of indexes to return for a given page and page size.

2. **Simple Pagination**: Introduce a `Server` class that enables pagination for the dataset of popular baby names stored in the CSV file "Popular_Baby_Names.csv." The class provides a method named `get_page` to retrieve specific pages from the dataset based on the given pagination parameters.

3. **Hypermedia Pagination**: Enhance the `Server` class by adding the `get_hyper` method. This method extends the pagination functionality by providing additional hypermedia information such as the current page size, current page number, next and previous pages, and the total number of pages in the dataset.

4. **Deletion-Resilient Hypermedia Pagination**: Build on the previous implementations and introduce the `get_hyper_index` method within the `Server` class. This method handles potential deletions in the dataset between different pagination queries, ensuring the user does not miss items when changing pages.

3. ## 0x03-queuing_system_in_js**

This repository contains a set of tasks that involve setting up and using a queuing system based on Redis and Kue. The tasks are designed to help you understand and implement various aspects of queuing systems, job processing, and Redis interactions using JavaScript.
